# Andrija's Simple Portfolio
This is the build repo for my personal web page.

## Description 👍
It's hosted on GitHub Pages.

Development repository: [my-portfolio](https://github.com/AndrijaS37N/my-portfolio)

## Pushing &#8615;
In order not to delete the dist folder in my project and the .git folder in it, I use this command to just overwrite the damn thing.
```
npm run build --no-delete-output-path
```
<strike>Update: May not work as intended it seems. Will post fixes at a later date.</strike>

I've seperated the repos locally, when pushing the build, I copy the dist folder to this repo.
