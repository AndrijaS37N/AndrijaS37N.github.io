# Andrija's Simple Portfolio

## Description 👍
This is my web page. It's hosted on GitHub Pages.

Development repository: [my-portfolio](https://github.com/AndrijaS37N/my-portfolio)

## Pushing &#8615;
In order not to delete the dist folder in my project and the .git folder in it, I use this command to just overwrite the damn thing.
```
npm run build --no-delete-output-path
```
